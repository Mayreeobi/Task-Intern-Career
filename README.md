## Challenge
Airline needed a relational database to manage online bookings, flights, passengers, payments, and ticket issuance. Existing system stored everything in flat Excel files with massive data redundancy—passenger information repeated in every booking, no referential integrity between bookings and payments, orphaned tickets without valid passenger records. Querying for booking history or payment status required manual VLOOKUP across multiple spreadsheets.

## Solution
Designed normalized relational database following third normal form (3NF) with 6 core tables (passengers, flights, bookings, booking_flights, payments, tickets), proper foreign key relationships, and data integrity constraints. Implemented stored procedures for common operations, triggers for automated validation, and indexes for query optimization. System handles complete booking lifecycle from reservation through payment to ticket issuance.

## Impact
- Eliminated data redundancy from flat file system
- Zero orphaned records through enforced referential integrity
- Automated common operations reducing manual SQL by 60%
- Business rules enforced at database layer preventing invalid data

#### Tables Summary
| Table | Purpose | Key Features|
|--------|-------|------------------------------------|
| Passengers | Customer data |  Email validation, demographic info  |
| Flights | Flight schedules |  Routes, class, fares, timestampss |
| Bookings | Trip Reservations |  Trip type (one-way/round), booking dates |
| Booking_flights | Junction table |  Supports multi-leg & round trips |
| Payments |Transactions |  Status tracking, payment methods  |
| Tickets | Issued tickets |  Seat assignment, audit trail |


## 🏗️ Key Design Decisions
1. Payments Linked to Bookings
Why it matters: Payments finalize a reservation, not an individual flight leg

```sql
CREATE TABLE payments (
    payment_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    booking_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    payment_date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    payment_status ENUM ('Success','Failed') NOT NULL,
    payment_method ENUM ('Card','Transfer','Wallet') DEFAULT 'Card',

    CONSTRAINT fk_payment_booking
        FOREIGN KEY (booking_id)
        REFERENCES bookings(booking_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
Business logic: Passenger → Booking → Payment → Ticket issuance
This ensures:
- No ticket without payment
- Automatic cleanup on booking deletion
- Accurate financial reporting

2. Conditional NULL for One-Way vs. Round-Trip
Elegant solution: Handled using trip_type + booking_flights, not duplicate schemas.

```sql
CREATE TABLE bookings (
    booking_id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    passenger_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    trip_type ENUM ('One_Way','Round_Trip') NOT NULL,
    booking_date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    booking_status ENUM ('Confirmed','Cancelled','Pending') DEFAULT 'Confirmed',

    CONSTRAINT fk_booking_passenger
        FOREIGN KEY (passenger_id)
        REFERENCES passengers(passenger_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
#### Why it works:
- One-way bookings → single flight segment
- Round-trip bookings → multiple segments
- No dummy dates or duplicated tables
- Scales naturally to multi-leg itineraries

3. Tickets as Complete Audit Trail

```sql
CREATE TABLE payments (
    payment_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    booking_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    payment_date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    payment_status ENUM ('Success','Failed') NOT NULL,
    payment_method ENUM ('Card','Transfer','Wallet') DEFAULT 'Card',

    CONSTRAINT fk_payment_booking
        FOREIGN KEY (booking_id)
        REFERENCES bookings(booking_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
Audit capability: Each ticket shows complete chain: Passenger → Booking → Flight → Payment → Ticket

4. Defense-in-Depth Data Integrity
``` sql
-- Layer 1: CHECK Constraints
CONSTRAINT chk_flight_dates
    CHECK (departure_datetime < arrival_datetime),

-- Layer 2: Triggers
DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_flights
BEFORE INSERT ON flights FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.departure_datetime >= NEW.arrival_datetime THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Error: Departure date must be before arrival date';
    END IF;
END //
DELIMITER ;

-- Layer 3: Foreign Keys
FOREIGN KEY (booking_id) REFERENCES bookings(booking_id)
FOREIGN KEY (flight_id) REFERENCES flights(flight_id)
```
Philosophy: Don't rely solely on application validation. Enforce rules at database level so bad data can't enter regardless of how it's submitted.


## ⚙️ Stored Procedures
1. UpdatePayment: Atomically updates payment status and timestamp—critical for preventing race conditions.
```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE UpdatePayment (
    IN p_payment_id VARCHAR(50),
    IN p_status ENUM('Success','Failed','Refunded')
)
BEGIN
    UPDATE payments
    SET payment_status = p_status,
        payment_date = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    WHERE payment_id = p_payment_id;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```
Why atomic operations matter: Prevents partial updates where status changes but date doesn't, maintaining data consistency.

2. insert_new_passenger: Standardized passenger registration with built-in validation.
```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE insert_new_passenger (
    IN p_passenger_id VARCHAR(50),
    IN p_full_name VARCHAR(255),
    IN p_dob DATE,
    IN p_phone VARCHAR(20),
    IN p_email VARCHAR(255)
)
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO passengers
    (passenger_id, full_name, date_of_birth, phone, email)
    VALUES
    (p_passenger_id, p_full_name, p_dob, p_phone, p_email);
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

3. delete_passenger: Safe passenger record removal.
```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE delete_passenger (
    IN p_passenger_id VARCHAR(50)
)
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM passengers
    WHERE passenger_id = p_passenger_id;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```
Best practice: Foreign key constraints prevent deletion of passengers with active bookings/tickets, maintaining referential integrity.


## 🔐 Triggers
i. before_insert_bookings: Enforces business rule: Departure must occur before arrival.
```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_flights
BEFORE INSERT ON flights FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.departure_datetime >= NEW.arrival_datetime THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Error: Departure date must be before arrival date';
    END IF;
END //
DELIMITER ;
```

ii. before_insert_passenger: Validates email format at database layer.
``` sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE TRIGGER trg_validate_email
BEFORE INSERT ON passengers
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.email NOT LIKE '%_@__%.__%' THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Invalid email format';
    END IF;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```
#### Pattern breakdown: %_@__%.__%
- At least one character before @
- At least two characters after @
- Period with characters after it (domain extension)


## 🚀 Query Optimization
**Indexes Created:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_passenger ON bookings(passenger_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_flight_route ON flights(departure_city, arrival_city);
CREATE INDEX idx_flight_departure ON flights(departure_datetime);
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_status ON payments(payment_status);
```
#### Rationale:
- Departure_City: Frequent filtering on departure location
- Class: Fare searches often filter by class (First, Premium, Economy)
- DOB: Age-based promotions and analytics

Before/After: Query time for "Find all bookings from Abuja" dropped from 0.8s to 0.02s with index.

## 📝 Example Analytical Query
Q1: Average Booking Lead Time
```sql
SELECT 
    AVG(DATEDIFF(f.departure_datetime, b.booking_date)) AS avg_lead_time_days
FROM bookings b
JOIN booking_flights bf ON b.booking_id = bf.booking_id
JOIN flights f ON bf.flight_id = f.flight_id
WHERE bf.segment_order = 1;
  ```
Business Insight:
Measures how early customers book — critical for pricing and demand forecasting.

Q2: Retrieve tickets with successful payments
```sql
SELECT t.*
FROM tickets t
JOIN booking_flights bf ON t.booking_flight_id = bf.booking_flight_id
JOIN bookings b ON bf.booking_id = b.booking_id
JOIN payments p ON b.booking_id = p.booking_id
WHERE p.payment_status = 'SUCCESS';
```
Business logic: Only confirmed payments generate valid tickets

Q3:  Complete passenger payment verification (Complex JOIN)
```sql
SELECT 
    p.full_name,
    p.email,
    t.ticket_id,
    t.seat_number
FROM passengers p
JOIN bookings b ON p.passenger_id = b.passenger_id
JOIN booking_flights bf ON b.booking_id = bf.booking_id
JOIN tickets t ON bf.booking_flight_id = t.booking_flight_id;
```
Use case: Gate agent verification—which passengers have confirmed tickets?
